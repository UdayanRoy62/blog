Here are some highlights:\n\n-   Inflation-adjusted Gross Value Added was INR 4,312,585.07 crores at constant 2011-12 prices. (A crore is ten million or 10<sup>7</sup>.)\n-   This represents a growth of [6.22 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"} compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. (The available quarterly data spans Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year. That's roughly 13 years. Over this period, GVA has grown [5.79 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Output of the *primary sector* (consisting of the Agriculture and Mining sectors) grew [5.2 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, primary sector output has grown [3.19 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Output of the *secondary sector* (consisting of the manufacturing sector, the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector, and the construction sector) grew [4.76 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, secondary sector output has grown [5.66 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Output of the *tertiary sector* (consisting of the trade hotels transport communication broadcasting sector, the financial real estate professional services sector, and the public administration defence and other services sector) grew [7.39 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, tertiary sector output has grown [7.13 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Within the primary sector, output of the *agriculture* sector grew [5.63 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, agriculture sector output has grown [3.34 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Also within the primary sector, output of the *mining* sector grew [1.41 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, mining sector output has grown [1.88 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Summary of the latest quarter: **It was slightly better than usual. Total inflation-adjusted output (*GVA*) grew *faster* than its long-run average (that is, the average since Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year). The *primary* and the *tertiary sectors* grew *faster* than their respective long-run average growth rates. The *secondary* sector grew *slower* than its long-run average growth rate.**\n\n### Background\n\nIn this report, I am looking at the Indian economy from the *supply* (or production) side. The Indian government publishes data every quarter on the incomes generated by economic activity in the various sectors of the economy. As the total of these sectoral incomes is the *Gross Value Added*, it is useful to compare each sector's income to the GVA.\n\nGVA is related to *Gross Domestic Product*, the measure of aggregate economic activity that most people are familiar with, in the following way: *GDP* = *GVA* + *Net Taxes* = *GVA* + (*Taxes* - *Subsidies*). Over the last 50 quarters or so, Net Taxes, which is the difference between GDP and GVA, has varied between 4 percent and 12 percent of GDP.\n\nThe various sectors of the Indian economy are grouped into the *Primary*, *Secondary*, and *Tertiary* sectors. So, the incomes generated by these three sectors add up to GVA. The Primary sector consists of *Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry and Fishing* (*Agriculture_plus* from now on) and *Mining and Quarrying* (*Mining_plus*). The Secondary sector consists of *Manufacturing*, *Construction, and Electricity, Gas, Water Supply and Other Utility Services* (*Electricity_plus*). The Tertiary sector consists of *Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Services related to Broadcasting* (*Trade_plus*), *Financial, Real Estate and Professional Services* (*Financial_plus*), and *Public Administration, Defence and Other Services* (*Public_Admin_plus*).\n\n## Gross Value Added, Level\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: Just eyeball the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic parts of the chart for a few seconds. Note the increased volatility *after* the pandemic, with sharp declines in the first quarter followed by equally sharp increases in the subsequent quarters. I wonder why this is so. Things seem to be returning to the pre-pandemic pattern (of mild increases). However, the question remains: *Why has the first quarter (April -- June) been so far below the pre-pandemic trend after the pandemic? Conversely, why has fourth quarter been so close to the pre-pandemic trend?*\n\n## Gross Value Added, Growth Rate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Components of GVA (*Primary*, *Secondary*, and *Tertiary*)\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!--\nGVA is the rupee value of all production, roughly speaking. This total output is usually broken down into *sectors*:\n\n-   primary sector's output,\n-   secondary sector's output, and\n-   tertiary sector's output.\n-->\n```\n\n\nIt is important to know which *sector*'s output contributes how much to total output (*GVA*) and its growth. Policy makers may be able to design better macroeconomic policies if they can spot the sector that is in trouble.\n\nThe charts below consist of *three* charts for each sector (or sub-sector).\n\n-   The *first* of the three charts for a particular sector shows the *growth rate* of that sector over the previous year (or four quarters).\n-   The *second* shows that sector's share of total output (that is, the sector's *share of GVA*).\n-   And the *third* shows the *increase* in the sector's income over the previous year as a share of the *increase* in GVA.\n\nEach chart shows the relevant values for each quarter as well as the relevant long-term average from 2011 onwards (shown with a dashed horizontal line).\n\n### Primary Sector\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the Primary sector was 19.73 percent of GVA in the latest quarter (Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year). This can be compared with the Primary sector's 18.52 percent share of GVA over the full data period (spanning Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: Note the seasonal pattern: highest share in the third quarter (Oct. -- Dec.) followed by declining shares in the rest of the year.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Secondary Sector\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the Secondary sector was 27.33 percent of GVA in the latest quarter. This can be compared with the Secondary sector's 28.33 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: The seasonal pattern is noticeable, though not as prominent as for the primary sector. In most years, the sector's share is lowest in the third quarter. This could simply be the effect of the seasonal swings in the primary sector: When the primary sector's share rises, the other sectors' shares fall. After all, the shares must add up to 100%.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Tertiary Sector\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the Tertiary sector was 52.94 percent of GVA in the latest quarter. This can be compared with the Tertiary sector's 53.15 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: Again, the seasonal pattern is noticeable. In most years, the sector's share is lowest in the third quarter followed by increasing shares in the rest of the year. This could simply be the effect of the seasonal swings in the primary sector: When the primary sector's share rises, the other sectors' shares fall.\n\n(It could be that the tertiary sector has an intrinsic seasonal pattern that affects the other two sectors. But that seems far fetched. It's more likely that seasonal cycles in agriculture's share of GVA drive the other sectors' shares, in the opposite direction.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## A Closer Look at the Primary Sector\n\n### Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the *Agriculture_plus* sector was 17.82 percent of GVA in the latest quarter. This can be compared with the Agriculture_plus sector's 15.88 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\n\nRecall that the corresponding shares for the Primary sector were 19.73 percent and 18.52 percent, respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: Note that the seasonal pattern in *Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing* is very similar to that in the Primary sector as a whole. This is not surprising because most of the Primary sector is Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing while *Mining and Quarrying* has a small residual share.\n\nNote also that Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing is in a long-term relative decline.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Mining and Quarrying\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the *Mining_plus* sector was 1.92 percent of GVA in the latest quarter.

I wonder why this is so. Could it be a lagged effect of the seasonal pattern in agriculture where peak shares are most often in the *third* quarter?\n\nAlso, note that this sector is in a clear long-term relative decline.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gva_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## A Closer Look at the Secondary Sector\n\n### Manufacturing\n\n*Importance*: Income generated in the *Manufacturing* sector was 16.12 percent of GVA in the latest quarter.
