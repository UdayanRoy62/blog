As the price of a share depends those payoffs, share prices rose sharply. And, remember, I am leaving out Trump's pandemic year. The depressing effect of the pandemic on asset prices probably hurt asset prices during Biden's term.\n\nThis turns out to be a recurring theme.

But blaming Biden for the higher inflation during his term is idiotic.\n\nVirtually every advanced country went through similar inflation at the same time, indicating the effect of a global phenomenon. The simultaneous reopening of the world's economies after the pandemic overwhelmed the global supply chains. The war in Ukraine disrupted global grain and oil markets.\n\nLarge expenditures by governments may have contributed a bit to the inflation, but it would have been moral malpractice for governments to not help people suffering from a once-a-century pandemic. Moreover, in most countries, the inflation faded without any increase in unemployment (the so-called \"soft landing\"). If the inflation went away without a big decrease in aggregate demand being required, it may be that the inflation was not caused by an increase in aggregate demand in the first place.\n\nFinally, inflation in the U.S. is traditionally the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, the central bank. Their experts -- whose main job is that of keeping an eye on inflation -- did not see the inflation coming. Consequently, they did not attack inflation in a timely manner.\n\nAll in all, Biden gets blamed for the inflation, but by a moronic media and an idiotic public who have no understanding of the issues and have no understanding of the availability of inflation-adjusted data on things like unemployment and GDP.\n\n# Jobs Added\n\n*Data*: [Total Nonfarm Payroll](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = my_q_data_2, mapping = aes(x = quarter_of_term, y = Jobs, colour = POTUS)) +\n  geom_line() +\n    labs(\n    title = \"Comparison of the first three years of the Trump and Biden terms\",\n    subtitle = \"Total Nonfarm Payroll, as a percentage of the value of a term's initial value\",\n    x = \"Quarter of Term\", y = \"Percent\",\n    color = \"President\", caption = \"FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_with_code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe chart shows total non-farm employment in the first 12 quarters of each presidential term as a percentage of its value in the first quarter of the term.

Inflation-adjusted wages and inflation-adjusted net worth grew faster in the first three years of Trump. But even in these cases, my decision to focus on the first three years of each presidential term helped Trump and disadvantaged Biden. The first three Trump years were untouched by the pandemic, whereas whereas the first three Biden years were heavily affected by the damaging after-effects of the pandemic. That is especially true of the high inflation in the Biden years.\n",
