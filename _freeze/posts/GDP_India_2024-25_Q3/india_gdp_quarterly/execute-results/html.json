Here are some highlights:\n\n-   Inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product was INR 4,716,992.50 crores at constant 2011-12 prices. (A crore is ten million or 10<sup>7</sup>.)\\\n-   This represents a growth of [6.15 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"} compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. (The available quarterly data spans Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year. That's roughly 13 years. Over this period, GDP has grown [5.95 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Consumption spending grew [6.91 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, consumption spending has grown [6.33 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Investment spending grew [4.99 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, investment spending has grown [5.12 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Government purchases grew [8.28 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, government purchases has grown [4.15 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\\\n-   Exports grew [10.38 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, exports has grown [4.99 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Imports grew [-1.09 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, imports has grown [3.04 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Net Exports grew [90.46 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 13 years, net exports has grown [5.18 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Summary of the latest quarter: **It was slightly better than usual. GDP growth was slightly above the long-run average, as was growth in consumption spending. Government spending and exports were the main story: they both grew twice as fast as they usually do. Investment spending was a disappointment, growing slower than usual.**\n\n## Gross Domestic Product, Level\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gdp_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: Just eyeball the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic parts of the chart for a second or two. Note the increased volatility *after* the pandemic, with sharp declines in the first quarter of each year followed by equally sharp increases in the subsequent quarters. I wonder why this is so. Things seem to be returning to the pre-pandemic pattern (of mild increases). However, the question remains: *Why has the first quarter (April -- June) been so far below the pre-pandemic trend after the pandemic? More puzzlingly, why has fourth quarter (January -- March) been so close to the pre-pandemic trend?*\n\n## Gross Domestic Product, Growth Rate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gdp_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Components of GDP (*C*, *I*, *G*, and *NX*)\n\nGDP is the rupee value of all production, roughly speaking. Consequently, GDP is also total income and total spending. Total spending is usually broken down into four *components*:\n\n-   consumption spending (*C*, which is present oriented),\n-   investment spending (*I*, which is future oriented),\n-   government purchases (*G*), and\n-   net exports (*NX* = *Exports* - *Imports*).\n\nTherefore, *GDP* = *C* + *I* + *G* + *NX*. It is important to know which *kind* of spending -- that is, which component of GDP -- contributes how much to GDP and its growth. Policy makers may be able to design better macroeconomic policies if they can spot the component that is causing trouble.\n\nThere are a dozen charts below, three for each of the four components.\n\n-   The *first* of the three charts for a particular component shows that component's *growth rate* over the previous year.\n-   The *second* shows that component's share of total spending (that is, its *share of GDP*) during each quarter.\n-   And the *third* shows the increase in that component over the previous year as a share of the increase in total spending over the previous year (that is, *its increase as a share of the increase in GDP*).\n\nEach chart shows the relevant values for each quarter as well as the relevant long-term average from 2011 onwards (shown with a dashed horizontal line).\n\n### Consumption Spending\n\n*Importance*: Consumption spending was 59.59 percent of GDP in the latest quarter (Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year). This can be compared with Consumption's 56.54 percent share of GDP over the full data period (spanning Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 3 of the 2024-25 fiscal year).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gdp_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gdp_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](india_gdp_quarterly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Investment Spending\n\n*Importance*: Investment spending was 34.96 percent of GDP in the latest quarter.
