Here are some highlights:\n\n-   Inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product was INR 18,488,380.91 crores at constant 2011-12 prices. (A crore is ten million or 10<sup>7</sup>.)\\\n-   This represents a growth of [6.37 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"} compared to the previous fiscal year. (The available data spans the 1950-51 fiscal year through the 2024-25 fiscal year. That's 74 years. Over the past 74 years, GDP has grown [5.01 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Consumption spending grew [7.28 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, consumption spending has grown [4.46 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Investment spending grew [6.36 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, investment spending has grown [5.96 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Government purchases grew [4.1 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, government purchases has grown [5.73 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\\\n-   Exports grew [5.91 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, exports has grown [6.81 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Imports grew [-1.31 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, imports has grown [6.76 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Net Exports grew [72.74 percent]{style=\"color: red;\"}. (Over the past 74 years, net exports has grown [-5.53 percent]{style=\"color: blue;\"} annually.)\n-   Summary of the latest quarter: **Weaker performance than usual. GDP growth was a bit higher than the long-run average, but quite a bit slower than in the last three years. Consumption spending grew nearly twice as fast as the post- Independence average. Investment grew just slightly faster than the post-Independence average.**\n\n## Gross Domestic Product, Level\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: [Steady growth. The historic nature of the COVID shock is clear.]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n## Gross Domestic Product, Growth Rate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: [Note that after 1980 -- and most certainly after 1990 -- there have been few instances of below-average growth. And barring the COVID shock the downturns have been mild after 1990. The difference between the pre-1990 and post-1990 periods is very clear.]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n## The Components of GDP (*C*, *I*, *G*, and *NX*)\n\nGDP is the rupee value of all production, roughly speaking. Consequently, GDP is also total income and total spending. Total spending is usually broken down into four *components*:\n\n-   consumption spending (*C*, which is present oriented),\n-   investment spending (*I*, which is future oriented),\n-   government purchases (*G*), and\n-   net exports (*NX* = *Exports* - *Imports*).\n\nTherefore, *GDP* = *C* + *I* + *G* + *NX*. It is important to know which *kind* of spending -- that is, which component of GDP -- contributes how much to GDP and its growth. Policy makers may be able to design better macroeconomic policies if they can spot the component that is causing trouble.\n\nThere are a dozen charts below, three for each of the four components.\n\n-   The *first* of the three charts for a particular component shows that component's *growth rate* over the previous year.\n-   The *second* shows that component's share of total spending (that is, its *share of GDP*) during each fiscal year.\n-   And the *third* shows the increase in that component over the previous year as a share of the increase in total spending over the previous year (that is, *its increase as a share of the increase in GDP*). [*Caution*: I am not quite sure about 1966. That year is a clear outlier and it throws off this third chart for every GDP component. I am aware that India went through a major macroeconomic crisis that year. But I am surprised by the way the third chart for every GDP component gets thrown off in 1966.]{style=\"color: blue;\"}\n\nEach chart shows the relevant values for each fiscal year as well as the relevant long-term average from 1950-51 onwards (shown with a dashed horizontal line).\n\n### Consumption Spending\n\n*Importance*: Consumption spending was 56.28 percent of GDP in 2024-25, the latest fiscal year. This can be compared with Consumption's 68.75 percent share of GDP over the full data period (1950-51 through 2024-25).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: [This is a striking chart and it depicts a big macroeconomic change in India since Independence. Consumption spending has fallen dramatically from approximately 85 percent of GDP in the early 1950s to 55 percent of GDP in recent years. The decline in the share of consumption spending seems to have stabilized over the last two decades.]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n[As can be seen in charts below, the decline in the share of consumption has been matched by increases in Investment and, to a lesser extent, Government Purchases.]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n[Why did these changes occur? Did government policies penalize consumption? Was it caused by an increase in income inequality? (Richer people save more; poorer people spend whatever they earn.)]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Comment*: [Something weird about the 1966 data is making this chart look weird.]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n### Investment Spending\n\n*Importance*: Investment spending was 34.64 percent of GDP in the latest fiscal year.
