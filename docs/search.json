    "text": "In this report, I am looking at the Indian economy from the supply (or production) side. The Indian government publishes data every quarter on the incomes generated by economic activity in the various sectors of the economy. The total of these sectoral incomes is the Gross Value Added. For this reason, when one wants to track the relative importance of the various sectors of the Indian economy, it is useful to compare each sector’s income to the GVA.\nGVA is related to Gross Domestic Product, the measure of aggregate economic activity that most people are familiar with, in the following way: GDP = GVA + Net Taxes = GVA + (Taxes - Subsidies). Over the last 50 quarters or so, Net Taxes, which is the difference between GDP and GVA, has varied between 4 percent and 12 percent of GDP.\nThe various sectors of the Indian economy are grouped into the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary sectors. So, the incomes generated by these three sectors add up to GVA. The Primary sector consists of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry and Fishing (Agriculture_plus from now on) and Mining and Quarrying (Mining_plus). The Secondary sector consists of Manufacturing, Electricity, Gas, Water Supply and Other Utility Services (Electricity_plus) and Construction. The Tertiary sector consists of Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Services related to Broadcasting (Trade_plus), Financial, Real Estate and Professional Services (Financial_plus), and Public Administration, Defence and Other Services (Public_Administration_plus)."

    "text": "The Latest Quarter At A Glance\nData on India’s Gross Value Added for Quarter 1 of the 2024-25 fiscal year has just been published. Here are some highlights:\n\nInflation-adjusted Gross Value Added was INR 4,072,734.04 crores at constant 2011-12 prices. (A crore is ten million or 107.)\n\nThis represents a growth of 6.84 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. (The available quarterly data spans Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 1 of the 2024-25 fiscal year. That’s 13 years. Over the past 13 years, GVA has grown 5.75 percent annually.)\nOutput of the primary sector (consisting of the Agriculture and Mining sectors) grew 2.73 percent. (Over the past 13 years, primary sector output has grown 3.4 percent annually.)\nOutput of the secondary sector (consisting of the manufacturing sector, the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector, and the construction sector) grew 8.43 percent. (Over the past 13 years, secondary sector output has grown 5.34 percent annually.)\nOutput of the tertiary sector (consisting of the trade hotels transport communication broadcasting sector, the financial real estate professional services sector, and the public administration defence and other services sector) grew 7.21 percent. (Over the past 13 years, tertiary sector output has grown 6.78 percent annually.)\nOutput of the agriculture sector grew 2 percent. (Over the past 13 years, agriculture sector output has grown 3.6 percent annually.)\nOutput of the mining sector grew 7.18 percent. (Over the past 13 years, mining sector output has grown 2.34 percent annually.)\nTo sum up the latest quarter, Total inflation-adjusted output (GVA) grew faster than its long-run average (that is, over my 13-year data period). The primary sector grew slower than its long-run average growth rate (which is itself a lot slower than the overall economy’s). Both the secondary and tertiary sectors grew faster than their respective long-run average growth rates (which are similar to that of the overall economy)."

Note the increased volatility after the pandemic, with sharp declines in the first quarter followed by equally sharp increases in the subsequent quarters. I wonder why this is so. Things seem to be returning to the pre-pandemic pattern (of mild increases). However, the question remains: Why has the first quarter (April – June) been so far below the pre-pandemic trend after the pandemic? Conversely, why has fourth quarter been so close to the pre-pandemic trend?"

    "text": "The Components of GVA (Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary)\n\nIt is important to know which sector’s output contributes how much to total output (GVA) and its growth. Policy makers may be able to design better macroeconomic policies if they can spot the sector that is causing trouble.\nThere are nine charts below, three for each of the three sectors.\n\nThe first of the three charts for a particular sector shows the growth rate of that sector’s income over the previous year (or four quarters).\nThe second shows that sector’s share of total income (that is, its share of GVA) during each quarter.\nAnd the third shows the increase in the sector’s income over the previous year as a share of the increase in total income (that is, its sectoral increase as a share of the increase in GVA).\n\nEach chart shows the relevant values for each quarter as well as the relevant long-term average from 2011 onwards (shown with a dashed horizontal line).\n\nPrimary Sector\nImportance: Income generated in the Primary sector was 15.32 percent of GVA in the latest quarter (Quarter 1 of the 2024-25 fiscal year). This can be compared with the Primary sector’s 18.58 percent share of GVA over the full data period (spanning Quarter 1 of the 2011-12 fiscal year through Quarter 1 of the 2024-25 fiscal year).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment: Note the seasonal pattern: highest share in the third quarter (Oct. – Dec.) followed by declining shares in the rest of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Sector\nImportance: Income generated in the Secondary sector was 28.45 percent of GVA in the latest quarter. This can be compared with the Secondary sector’s 28.35 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment: The seasonal pattern is noticeable, though not as prominent as for the primary sector. In most years, the sector’s share is lowest in the third quarter. This could simply be the effect of the seasonal swings in the primary sector: When the primary sector’s share rises, the other sectors’ shares fall. After all, the shares must add up to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTertiary Sector\nImportance: Income generated in the Tertiary sector was 56.24 percent of GVA in the latest quarter. This can be compared with the Tertiary sector’s 53.06 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment: Again, the seasonal pattern is noticeable. In most years, the sector’s share is lowest in the third quarter followed by increasing shares in the rest of the year. This could simply be the effect of the seasonal swings in the primary sector: When the primary sector’s share rises, the other sectors’ shares fall.\n(It could be that the tertiary sector has an intrinsic seasonal pattern that affects the other two sectors. But that seems far fetched. It’s more likely that seasonal cycles in agricultural drive the other sectors’ shares.)"

This can be compared with the Agriculture_plus sector’s 15.9 percent share of GVA over the full data period.\nRecall that the corresponding shares for the Primary sector were 15.32 percent and 18.58 percent, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment: Note that the seasonal pattern in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing is very similar to that in the Primary sector as a whole. This is not surprising because most of the Primary sector is Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing while Mining and Quarrying has a small residual share.\nNote also that Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing is in a long-term relative decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMining and Quarrying\nImportance: Income generated in the Mining_plus sector was 2.25 percent of GVA in the latest quarter.

I wonder why this is so. Could it be a lagged effect of the seasonal pattern in agriculture where peak shares are most often in the third quarter?\nAlso, note that this sector is in a clear long-term relative decline."
